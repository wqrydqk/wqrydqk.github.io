These are the projects as well as the research I did during my M.S. and B.S. periods.
## UMich: Mechatronic System Design Labs and Projects                            
#### Time:  08/2021-12/2021

* Gained comprehensive knowledge of all six labs, including Electronic Circuit (Lab 1), Magnetic Levitation System (Lab 2), DC Motor Servo System (Lab 3), Inverted Pendulum System (Lab 4), Inertial Sensors (Lab 5), and Stepper Motor (Lab 6).
* Successfully assembled hardware components and established circuit connections, showcasing the ability to design a lead controller for Lab 2, a PID controller for Lab 3, and an LQR controller for Lab 4.
* Leveraged Simulink for system simulations in Labs 2, 3, and 4, refining system analysis and design skills.
