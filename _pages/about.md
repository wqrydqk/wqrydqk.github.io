I currently work as a chassis control engineer at [Li Auto](https://ir.lixiang.com/). I got my Bachelor of Science degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/), majoring in Mechanical Engineering; and I obtained my Master of Science degree from [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://me.engin.umich.edu/), where I concentrated my track on Control. My research and project interest is dynamics and controls in various systems or plants.
